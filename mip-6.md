# [MIP-6] Uses Feature Deprecation

# Overview

The Uses feature was introduced into Token Metadata version 1.1 and was intended for gaming or ticketing use cases where an NFT or Fungible token could degrade or be burnt after usage. However, this feature has seen very little use and it is recommended that it be removed from the Token Metadata program

# Motivation

The main motivation behind the proposal to remove Uses is due to its very limited use compared to the technical debt and maintenance overhead it causes to the program. Additionally, it is a feature that would be better supported by composable protocols external to the Token Metadata program. Fairly simple Uses replacements could be designed using the new Delegate system enabled on pNFTs.

# Proposal

It is Metaplex’s proposal that the Uses feature of NFTs be deprecated and eventually removed from Token Metadata as it incurs technical debt greater than the utility it currently provides
